## Why Fintpe?

Most finance apps want your attention, your data, and your money. We don't.

- **No clutter** — Clean interface, no ads, no promotions, no "recommended" products
- **No spam** — Zero marketing emails, push notifications only when you want them
- **No tracking** — Your financial data stays yours. We don't sell, share, or analyze it
- **No lock-in** — Export everything, anytime. It's your data

## What You Get

**One place to see everything:**

- 💰 **Net Worth Tracking** — See your complete financial picture at a glance
- 🏦 **All Accounts** — Bank accounts, credit cards, investments in one view
- 📊 **Asset Overview** — Track what you own: cash, investments, property, gold
- 📈 **Investment Performance** — Monitor mutual funds, stocks, SIPs without switching apps
- 📉 **Expense Analytics** — Know where your money goes with automatic categorization
- 📅 **Bill Reminders** — Never miss a payment

## Philosophy

**Do it yourself, your way.**

We believe personal finance should be personal. No robo-advisors pushing products. No "smart" recommendations based on your spending. No gamification trying to keep you hooked.

Just clean tools to track, understand, and manage your money — on your terms.
