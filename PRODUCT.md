# Fintpe — Product Context & Pitch

## What is Fintpe?

Fintpe is a **privacy-first personal finance dashboard** for Indians who want to see their complete financial picture — without tracking every transaction.

**Tagline:** "Your private finance dashboard"

**Core philosophy:** We don't track your transactions. We don't need to know what you bought or where. We just help you see the big picture — what you own, what you owe, and what's coming up.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Most people have no idea what their true financial picture looks like:
- Money scattered across 5 different bank accounts
- Investments in MFs, stocks, FDs, PPF — but no single view
- Loans and EMIs they're paying off
- Insurance policies they've forgotten about
- Documents buried in email or paper files

They're not looking to track every ₹50 chai. They just want to know: **"Where do I actually stand?"**

## The Key Insight

Most finance apps obsess over transactions:
> "You spent ₹450 at Starbucks on Tuesday"

Fintpe focuses on the big picture:

**We help you zoom out, not zoom in.**
